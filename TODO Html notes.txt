HTML Structure:
A div with the class todo-container wraps the entire to-do list.
An h1 heading for the title.
An input-container div that holds the input field and the "Add Task" button.
An ul element with the ID taskList to display the tasks.
CSS Styling:
Basic styling for the body, todo-container, input elements, buttons, and list items.
Uses flexbox for layout and alignment.
Adds subtle box shadows and border radii for visual appeal.
Colors have been added for visual appeal.
JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript code remains the same, providing the dynamic functionality for adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
The javascript is placed at the bottom of the body, this is best practice.
